## Tips for Success

**Good capture names:**
- Short: `recipe` not `my-favorite-pasta-recipe`
- Memorable: `guitar` not `vid123`
- Letters only: `news` not `news-2024`

**Use tags** to organize:
- Add tags like `work`, `recipe`, `music` when saving
- Filter by tag in the browser (`Ctrl+Alt+B`)

**The `?` suffix** shows all options:
- Forgot what suffixes exist? Type `myname?`
- A menu pops up with every action available
