# ContentCapture Pro v5.9 Released - Now with Share & Import!

Hey everyone! 👋

Just pushed a big update to ContentCapture Pro - you can now **share captures with other users**!

## What's New

**Share Button** (`Ctrl+S`) - Export one or more captures to:
- Clipboard (JSON format)
- `.ccp` file (for email/file sharing)

**Import Button** (`Ctrl+I`) - Bring in captures someone shared with you

## The Cool Part

When you share a capture, **everything transfers**:
- ✅ URL, title, body, tags
- ✅ Your opinion/notes
- ✅ Research notes (fact-check results, bias ratings)
- ✅ YouTube transcripts
- ✅ AI summaries
- ✅ Attached images (embedded as Base64!)

Images are embedded directly in the export - no separate files to manage. When the recipient imports, images auto-restore to their `images/` folder.

## Smart Import

The import preview shows exactly what you're getting:
- Which captures are ready to import
- Which ones conflict with existing captures
- Icons showing what's included (📷 image, 🔬 research, 📝 transcript)

Conflict handling lets you skip, replace, or rename duplicates.

## Why This Matters

- **Share verified content** with family/friends (complete with your research)
- **Build team knowledge bases** 
- **Help new users** with starter capture packs
- **Portable backups** that include everything
