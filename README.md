2. **No green H?** Double-click `ContentCapture.ahk` to start the program

### "I see an error about v2"

You installed the wrong version! Go to [autohotkey.com/download](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) and make sure you download **v2.0** (the top option), NOT v1.1

### "Windows blocked the program"

This is normal! Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"** - the program is safe!

### "Where are my recipes saved?"

In a file called `captures.dat` - **DON'T DELETE THIS FILE!** It has all your saves!
